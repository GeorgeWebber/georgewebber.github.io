I am a second-year PhD researcher working on generative deep learning and medical image reconstruction. Currently, I study at King's College London, UK, where I am supervised by Prof. Andrew Reader.

Before my PhD, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford, graduating with a double first in my Integrated Master's degree.

<!-- My personal interests include tennis, running, playing piano and saxophone. -->

This website is intended to document my research journey and serve as a one-stop shop for people interested in my work.

<!-- I am a PhD student at the EPSRC Smart Medical Imaging CDT. Based at King's College London, I research applications of AI to improving PET image reconstruction techniques, under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Reader. My goal is to develop novel and efficient methods that can enhance the quality and accuracy of PET images, and facilitate better diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

Before joining KCL, I completed my master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Oxford, with a First+Distinction. I studied topics such as geometric deep learning, computational biology, deep learning in healthcare, computational learning theory, and graph representation learning. I also gained valuable industry experience as an intern at Microsoft and Man Group, where I worked on projects focused on software engineering and researching new risk analytic measures respectively. -->
