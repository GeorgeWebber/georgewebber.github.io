ðŸš€ Excited to announce the publication of my first [review article](/publications/#webber2024diffusion)! ðŸ“„âœ¨

As part of my PhD, Iâ€™ve been working on incorporating AI into the reconstruction of medical images from scanners like MRI & PET. A major recent breakthrough in this area is the use of diffusion models, a cutting-edge AI framework you might recognize from tools like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.

In this review, Prof. Andrew Reader and I provide a clear and accessible introduction to image reconstruction and diffusion models, offering practical guidance for integrating diffusion-model-based reconstruction techniques. We also discuss the unique challenges of applying these methods to different imaging modalities and highlight the key research directions in the field. Finally, we explore the exciting opportunitiesâ€”and hurdlesâ€”that come with using diffusion models for medical image reconstruction.
