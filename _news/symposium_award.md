Last week, I had the opportunity to present my research at the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences Postgraduate Research Symposium. Iâ€™m honored to have received the Best Oral Presentation award for my work on personalized diffusion models for PET image reconstruction! ðŸŽ‰

A huge thank you to everyone who helped organize the event. It was a great chance to share my research, learn about the exciting work others are doing, and engage in many insightful discussions with fellow researchers.
