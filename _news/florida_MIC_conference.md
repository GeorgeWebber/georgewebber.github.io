I presented two papers on the subject of solving the PET image reconstruction problem with diffusion models at the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Medical Imaging Conference (IEEE MIC).

The [first paper](/publications/#webber2024generative_pet), presented orally, showed the benefits of using diffusion models to help reconstruct real 3D PET data.

The [second paper](/publications/#webber2024multi_subject), presented as a poster, demonstrated a proof-of-principle that registering training data to an anatomical space prior to training a diffusion model improves its performance on reconstruction tasks.
