### Year averages
<ul>
    <li>Year 2: 74%</li>
    <li>Year 3: 76%</li>
    <li>Year 4: 82%</li>
</ul>

### What I studied:

#### Year 4
<ul>
    <li>Computational Biology</li>
    <li>Computational Learning Theory</li>
    <li>Deep Learning in Healthcare</li>
    <li>Geometric Deep Learning</li>
    <li>Graph Representation Learning</li>
</ul>

As part of my master's year, I undertook a dissertation on the security of wearable payment devices. Specifically, I worked with a biometric system that authenticated user's based on their gestures. Working with variational autoencoders, I developed a pipeline for generating synthetic user gestures that could be used to accelerate a user's enrolment into the authentication system.

#### Year 3
<ul>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Computational Complexity</li>
    <li>Computer Graphics</li>
    <li>Continuous Martingales and Stochastic Calculus</li>
    <li>Geometric Modelling</li>
    <li>Information Theory</li>
    <li>Logic and Proof</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Probability, Measure and Martingales</li>
    <li>Quantum Information</li>
</ul>

#### Year 2
<ul>
    <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
    <li>Integration</li>
